Every historical blunder is a valuable lesson, every triumph a blueprint for success. You watch documentaries screaming, 'SEE?! THIS IS WHY!' at the screen. You're basically history's unpaid consultant, convinced that if only modern society listened to your insights, all our problems would vanish. You align with Hegel's concept of **Pragmatic History**, drawing direct moral or practical lessons from the past. Keep fighting the good fight, you magnificent moralizer! 🚀📖"

You live for the thrill of exposing historical inaccuracies, re-interpreting tired narratives, and generally making everyone uncomfortable with how much you know about what *really* happened. You're the Sherlock Holmes of the past, always sniffing out the untold story, the hidden bias, the secret agenda. Hegel would categorize you as a practitioner of **Critical History**, challenging existing accounts and seeking to reinterpret the record.
